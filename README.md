# Project Title 
Employee Productivity Analysis

# Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing employee performance data to measure productivity and identify the key factors influencing it. Using Excel, data was cleaned, processed, and visualized through charts and dashboards. The analysis provides actionable insights into employee performance, training effectiveness, departmental KPIs, and demographic patterns.

# Project Overview

The project uses employee datasets to track and analyze productivity. A dashboard was created in Excel with multiple charts, covering:
1. KPI success rates (by department & age group)
2. Awards distribution across departments
3. Average training scores (by education, recruitment channel, and age)
4. Length of service by gender
5. Performance trends by age

# Project Objectives

1. Analyze employee performance data to assess productivity.
2. Define productivity metrics and benchmarks (KPI success rate, training scores, length of service).
3. Identify patterns and correlations in performance across demographics, departments, and recruitment channels.
4. Provide recommendations to enhance overall employee productivity.

# Analysis Performed (Using Excel)

1. KPI Success Rate:
Department-wise and age-wise analysis.
Found that success rate differs between adults and seniors.

2. Awards Distribution:
Sales & Marketing received the majority of awards (29.5%).

3. Training Effectiveness:
Recruitment channel “Sourcing” led to the highest average training scores.
Education background also influenced training outcomes.

3. Length of Service:
Male employees had significantly longer average service duration compared to females.

4. Age vs Training Score:
Peak training scores observed between ages 28–34, then gradually declined.

# Tools Used

Microsoft Excel
Pivot Tables for summarization
Charts (Bar, Column, Pie, Line) for visualization
Conditional Formatting for benchmarks
Functions (IF, IFS, AVERAGE, etc.) for calculations

# Key Learnings

1. Importance of data cleaning for reliable insights.
2. How visualizations help in understanding performance patterns.
3. Identifying productivity factors like training scores, recruitment channel, and age group.
4. Building an interactive Excel dashboard to communicate insights clearly.
5. Applying business problem-solving skills through data analytics.

# Questions

1. Prepare an analysis of the KPI success rate across departments – which departments have higher/lower success?
2. Make a comparison of KPI success rate between adults and senior employees – who performs better?
3. Build a pie chart showing the percentage of awards won by each department – which department dominates?
4. Design a bar chart of average training scores across education backgrounds – which education level scores highest?
5. Create a gender-wise analysis of length of service – do males or females serve longer?
6. Prepare recruitment channel insights – which channel (Sourcing, Referred, Other) gives the best training performance?
7. Make a line chart of average training scores across age – at what age is training effectiveness highest?
8. Build a comparison of departments in terms of training scores vs. awards – do award-winning departments also have high training scores?
